# Sentiment Analysis of Twitter data - Introduction to NLP

## Pre-requisites

To be able to complete this project, you should be comfortable with basic Python and Jupyter notebooks. Are you…

* familiar with the concepts explained in courses 1-9 in Codeacademy’s “[Learn Python][code_academy]” track? 
* able to run and use a [Jupyter notebook][jupyter]?

Then, you’re good to go! You will learn the rest of the concepts through completing the project. 

##Project description

In this project you will study and analyse twitter data. The ultimate goal of the project is to build an algorithm that 
will determine if a given tweet has a positive or negative sentiment. This is called **sentiment analysis** and it is used 
in a wide range of situations in industry: news classification, review analysis, customer satisfaction, etc. In the journey 
to the final goal, you will learn:

* Load, read and analyse unstructured (text) data
* Question and understand your data through basic statistical analyses and visualisations
* Manipulate and transform data
* Principles of Machine Learning and Logistic regression. Logistic Regression is a basic Machine Learning algorithm, but
 sets the bases for more complex algorithms like neural networks
* Train and evaluate a Logistic Regression model
* Model deployment: You will build a small web server to serve your model. This server will accept HTTP requests containing 
one or more tweets, and it will output the result of our classifications (positive/negative tweet)
