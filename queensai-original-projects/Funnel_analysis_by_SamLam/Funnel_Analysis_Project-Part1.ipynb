    "## What is funnel analysis? \n",
    "\n",
    "Tomi Mester has an excellent blog post on this: https://data36.com/funnel-analysis/\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Funnel analysis is a powerful analytics method that shows visually the conversion between the most important steps of the user journey.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common types of analysis in industry is an onboarding funnel analysis, which are the steps that a user goes from registering on a website to the point they do a key action that the product offers. Examples of a key action in onboarding funnels could be:\n",
    "- for a music-streaming service like Spotify, this could be when a user presses play for a song\n",
    "- for an email provider such as Gmail, this could be when a user sends an email\n",
    "- for a mobile game like Candy Crush, this could be from when a user downloads the app to when they have completed their first level.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Come up with your own ideas around other online services you know on what a key action they would want their user to perform to get an understanding of what their product does!**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will go through how we would do this at Mentimeter (https://www.mentimeter.com/). If you don't already know what Mentimeter is, I highly recommend you check it out ;) In essence, Mentimeter is an interactive presentation platform where you can engage the audience with real-time interaction such as polls and word clouds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key action we want the registered user to engage in to understand the value of Mentimeter is to present live in front of an audience. In other words, when a user's presentation has received 2 votes or more.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: Each Step corresponds roughly to one week of the course at queensai so the discussion points each week will revolve around the topic in the Step.*"

    "How do we represent a user? We use what is called a user ID. A user ID is a unique identifier, commonly used to log on to a website, app, or online service, e.g. it may be a username, account number, or email address. (You can read a bit more about this at: https://techterms.com/definition/user_id). So if it is a username, what data type would that be? What about an account number? Or an email address then?"
